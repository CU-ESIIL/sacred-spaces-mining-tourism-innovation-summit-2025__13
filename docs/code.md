# Sprint code & workflows

This page highlights the runnable pieces of the Sacred Spaces sprint. Each entry links to scripts or notebooks in the `code/` folder and describes the expected inputs, outputs, and how to run the workflow.

## 1. Suitability scoring notebook
**File:** [`code/fired_time_hull_panel.ipynb`](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/code/fired_time_hull_panel.ipynb)

- **What it does:** Combines mobility, cultural buffer, and slope layers to compute a suitability score for potential visitor corridors.
- **Inputs:** GeoJSON layers stored in `data/` plus configuration cells in the notebook.
- **Run it:** Launch in JupyterLab (CyVerse recommended) and execute sequentially; final cells export `outputs/suitability_surface.tif` and a PNG map for the homepage.
- **Outputs:** Suitability raster, ranked corridor table, static map for storytelling.

## 2. Quick visualization prototype
**File:** [`code/single_hull_demo.py`](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/code/single_hull_demo.py)

- **What it does:** Demonstrates how to plot visitor corridors with Matplotlib + GeoPandas using the suitability scores.
- **Inputs:** `data/suitability_summary.geojson` (generated by the notebook above).
- **Run it:**
  ```bash
  python code/single_hull_demo.py
  ```
- **Outputs:** `outputs/hull_demo.png` for inclusion on the homepage.

## 3. Data processing stubs
**Files:** [`code/data_processing.md`](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/code/data_processing.md) and [`code/prism_quicklook.py`](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/code/prism_quicklook.py)

- **What they do:** Document baseline ETL steps for wrangling environmental context layers (PRISM climate snapshots, land cover, etc.).
- **Inputs:** Remote paths referenced in the markdown file and CLI arguments inside `prism_quicklook.py`.
- **Run it:** Follow the notes in `data_processing.md`; execute `python code/prism_quicklook.py --help` to explore options.
- **Outputs:** Quicklook rasters saved under `outputs/prism/` for overlays.

## 4. Storytelling assets
**File:** [`code/visualizations.md`](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/code/visualizations.md)

- **What it does:** Curates recommended chart styles, color palettes, and template layouts for the final brief and homepage.
- **Inputs:** Links to shared Figma frames and exported image assets.
- **Run it:** Follow design prompts; update with new embeds as they are created.
- **Outputs:** Consistent visuals for the homepage, PDF brief, and partner presentations.
