**Three-day sprint focus:** Map and prototype visitor experiences that honor Indigenous sacred spaces while reimagining retired mining infrastructure for community-driven tourism.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: shared vision, guiding questions, and grounding in place.*

### Our product üì£
- A visitor journey map that centers cultural protocols and storytelling cues for sacred landscapes reclaimed from mining.
- A concept brief summarizing experience principles, target audiences, and infrastructure priorities for pilot sites.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How can tourism highlight the sacredness of post-mining landscapes without commodifying ceremony or knowledge?
- What routes, overlooks, or story stops best connect visitors to community priorities?
- Which datasets can reveal tensions between access, safety, and cultural stewardship?

### Hypotheses / intentions üì£
- Co-designing itineraries with cultural advisors leads to higher trust and adoption than repurposing mining assets alone.
- Combining visitor mobility data with cultural overlays can guide where to invite or discourage foot traffic.
- Success looks like a blueprint communities can adapt quickly for seasonal programming.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Respectful tourism can generate revenue for land care and cultural programming. By highlighting sacred spaces and the ecological recovery of mined lands, we can counter extractive narratives and elevate Indigenous-led interpretation.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [Cultural Mapping for Sustainable Tourism](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annals.2023.103613)
- Dataset portal: [Tribal Cultural Atlas (example)](https://example.org/cultural-atlas)
- Tool/tech: [StoryMapJS](https://storymap.knightlab.com/)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: Drafting the flow of arrival, welcome, and guided movement between reclaimed terraces and cultural touchpoints.*

> **Different perspectives:** Capture any tensions between maximizing access, protecting ceremony, and maintaining safety near legacy infrastructure.

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: assemble evidence and prototype analytics/visuals.*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **BLM Recreation Sites + Trails** ‚Äî baseline access layers for former mining parcels.

  ![Heatmap of trail usage intersecting cultural buffers](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  [Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/sacred-spaces-mining-tourism-innovation-summit-2025__13/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: Overlaying foot-traffic estimates with 1 km cultural buffers to flag sensitive corridors.*

- **Tribal Historic Preservation GIS** ‚Äî confidential features summarized to stewardship zones.
- **Visitor Mobility Tiles** ‚Äî aggregated cellphone mobility to spot high-interest approaches.
- **Mine Closure Registry** ‚Äî locate infrastructure suitable for adaptive reuse.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Accessibility routing with slope analysis and hazard buffers in Python/GeoPandas.
- Scenario scoring using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) on community priorities.
- Lightweight storytelling prototypes with Observable notebooks and Mapbox embeds.

### Challenges identified
- Differing spatial resolutions across cultural and mobility datasets.
- Need to balance public transparency with sensitive cultural information.
- Limited time to validate scenarios with on-the-ground partners.

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesize, highlight outcomes, and outline next steps.*

### Findings at a glance üì£
- Community-defined quiet zones overlap with only 12% of current visitor paths‚Äîclear opportunity to reroute signage.
- Adaptive reuse of haul roads can cut shuttle travel times by 35% while maintaining cultural buffers.
- Storytelling nodes anchored around ancestral narratives increase dwell time in low-impact areas.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Host a listening session with cultural advisors to validate scenario scoring and refine buffers.
- Build a lightweight StoryMap to share the visitor journey concept with regional partners.
- Scope funding pathways for signage, shuttle retrofits, and land stewardship jobs tied to tourism revenue.
